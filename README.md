<!-- Embarking on a dynamic journey from applied electronics to software engineering, my career has been shaped by an insatiable curiosity and a passion for numbers.

I find purpose in telling the story of Jesus at [@GoFamille](https://github.com/GoFamille), and I extend that love to everything I do. Helping young people discover their life mission and harness their talents is a rewarding adventure.

Today, I devote my technical genius to any project that can help humanity, in particular the development of artificial intelligence in the fields of health and education.

At the moment I'm working on [@GoBackend](https://github.com/GoBackend), a tool to automate the creation and deployment of RESTFul Web APIs with Python and Google Gemini, which will be the backend engine for a community platform and others. -->
